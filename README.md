# H1 Climbing Area Finder
https://stevenmilano.github.io/climbing-area-finder/<br>
Sometimes it's hard to find a place to go rock climbing around you.
Especially if you live in a place with very small crags. This tool is designed to find places near you that you might have not known before. 

# H1 Motivation
I live in a place where it's really hard to find a place to climb outdoors thats less than a few hours a way.
I know the places exist but it's so hard to sort all the information. I wanted to solve that.'
